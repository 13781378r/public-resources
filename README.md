# Welcome to Open Source Maintainers on GitHub!
The GitHub maintainer community is a place for open source maintainers on GitHub to collaborate with each other, and with GitHubbers.

To create a safe space for free exchange of ideas, we’ve made this community private. If you’d like to discuss best practices in a public space, head on over to GitHub’s [Open Source Guides](https://github.com/github/open-source-guide).

# How do I join?
The community is open to active open source maintainers on GitHub with a demonstrated interest in collaborating on best practices.

_What is a maintainer?_ Maintainers are the stewards of an open source project. They spend much of their time thinking about the people and organizational aspects behind the project, beyond the project’s creative output (such as code). Maintainers might spend their time reviewing others’ contributions, responding to issues, evangelizing the project, or managing releases.

We’re starting with a small, but growing, group of maintainers to ensure a good experience. If you’d like to join, drop us a line at opensource@github.com, and we’ll review as we add more members.
