# Welcome to Open Source Maintainers on GitHub!
The GitHub maintainer community is a place for some open source maintainers on GitHub to collaborate with each other, and with GitHub.

To create a safe space for free exchange of ideas, we’ve made this community private.

If you’d like:

- to learn open source best practices, check out the [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide)
- find open source data for research, check out the [Open Source Survey](http://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/)
- a framework for regular open source contribution, along with resources to help you convince your employers to join in, check out [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/)

# How do I join?
We’ve starting with a small group of maintainers to ensure a good experience. We're not taking new applications at this time but will reconsider this in future.
