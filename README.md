# Welcome to Open Source Maintainers on GitHub!
The GitHub maintainer community is a place for open source maintainers on GitHub to collaborate with each other, and with GitHub.

To create a safe space for free exchange of ideas, we’ve made this community private.

If you’d like:

- to learn open source best practices, check out the [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide)
- find open source data for research, check out the [Open Source Survey](http://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/)
- a framework for regular open source contribution, along with resources to help you convince your employers to join in, check out [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/)

# How do I join?
The community is open to active open source maintainers on GitHub with a demonstrated interest in collaborating on best practices. We’re starting with a small, but growing, group of maintainers to ensure a good experience. We're relying on nominations from existing members to grow the community at this time.

_What is a maintainer?_ Maintainers are the stewards of an open source project. They spend much of their time thinking about the people and organizational aspects behind the project, beyond the project’s creative output (such as code). Maintainers spend their time reviewing others’ contributions, responding to issues, evangelizing the project, or managing releases.
